# Frontend_Backend_Task1
React and Django is integrated in this project

Here on the basic port or URL i.e. on 127.0.0.1:8000 you can see the Webpage which is built in React and then built with "npm run build" command then I copy pasted the 'build' named folder in our backend folder named 'djangobackend'.
So basically, our Data flow from the backend of our django to the frontend in the react is also happening and also I integrated the Basic page i.e. the index page with our backend.
